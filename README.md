# OpenForensics: Large-Scale Challenging Dataset For Multi-Face Forgery Detection And Segmentation In-The-Wild

![Header](images/teaser.jpg)

## Overview:

OpenForensics dataset is specifically designed for multi-face forgery detection and segmentation tasks. 
The version 1.0.0 consists of 115K in-the-wild images with 334K human faces. 
All images have face-wise rich annotations, such as forgery category, bounding box, segmentation mask, 
forgery boundary, and general facial landmarks.
OpenForensics dataset has great potentials for research in both deepfake prevention and general human 
face detection.

## Install

> pip install pycocotools

## Running
 
### Visualization

- Install: https://github.com/ltnghia/video-maskrcnn
